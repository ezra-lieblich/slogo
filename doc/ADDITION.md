###Estimation
I believe that it will take me 15 minutes to add these new commands. I believe I need to add two commands that extend the
DisplayProperties command since these additional commands are similar to other display commands in that it is
associated with the GUI Display. In addition, I need to add the commands path to the resource file which handles the 
reflection to instantiate the commands. Finally I need to create the skeleton methods in the GUI that the commands will 
attach their listeners to and call when the values change so I dont get an error.
