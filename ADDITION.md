Estimation: before looking at the old code:
=====

 * How long do you think it will take you to complete this new feature?<br/>I think it will take me about an hour.
 * How many files will you need to add or update? Why?<br/>I think I'll have to only update 2 files. This is because I plan to make a new class and make an existing class, GUIDisplay, call it.

Review: after completing the feature:
=

 * How long did it take you to complete this new feature?<br/>This took me 1.5 hours.
 * How many files did you need to add or update? Why?<br/>I ended up changing 2 files as I expected. For the reason, refer back to my answers in the Estimation section.
 * Did you get it completely right on the first try?<br/>I did not. I had some small bugs that I needed to go back and fix.

Analysis: what do you feel this exercise reveals about your project's design and documentation?
=

 * Was it as good (or bad) as you remembered?<br/>This was as good as I remembered because the resources I needed were readily available where I thought they would be.
 * What could be improved?<br/>I duplicated some code to do this extension, so yes. That code could be refactored out.
 * What would it have been like if you were not familiar with the code at all?<br/>This may have been somewhat more difficult, but definitely still doable. The part I dealt with was quite easy to understand.
