Estimation: before looking at the old code:

how long do you think it will take you to complete this new feature?

I think this will take me about an hour to implement. 

how many files will you need to add or update? Why?

I should only have to change one or two files in order to do this, as we have already implemented a feature that works with clicking on individual turtles.  

Review: after completing the feature:

how long did it take you to complete this new feature?

It took me a little over an hour.

how many files did you need to add or update? Why?

I needed to update the GUIDisplay class, to change what happened on the mouseclick of a turtle. 

did you get it completely right on the first try?

No, I messed up several times. But hey, that's coding.

Analysis: what do you feel this exercise reveals about your project's design and documentation?

I think that this shows that my groups code was not very well documented. I struggled to find the right spots to work on this, and I'm the one who wrote it not that long ago. We definitely would have benefitted from documenting the code better.  

was it as good (or bad) as you remembered?

It was about what I expected, but I will say I think too many methods were too big. I definitely saw some ways to refactor code. 

what could be improved?

I think that the main thing to be improved is our documentation and our naming of methods. For example, the method "getImage" returns an ImageView, which is just bad design. This is bound to leave people confused and struggling to interact with our code. And the lack of documentation makes it very hard to find the certain code you are looking for. 

what would it have been like if you were not familiar with the code at all?

It would have been very difficult to figure this out if I did not already know the code I was looking for. Since I knew we had previously implemented a clicking feature, I knew exactly what to look for. However, without the previous knowledge, this would have been way harder to find. We put the functionality in a method called "addTurtle" which is not at all what this code is doing, so it doesn't make sense to have it there.
